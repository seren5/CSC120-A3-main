Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I talked to Tanya and Neila while working on this assignment to discuss our interpretations on how the code should run, as well as the plan we had for it.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended TA hours on Tuesday, February 13th.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
My initial impressions of Java are that it's a lot more finnicky than Python is, and is more strict in terms of brackets and semi-colons or phrasing.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
In general, I'd say that programming requires a plan before you start, as well as some knowledge of the steps one will take to complete the program before you even get started.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The brackets did not work for me, and caused me a lot of confusion. For someone taking this course in the future, I'd give them a heads up to make sure they're remembering to check where each bracket is opened and closes so that they aren't confused for a long time like I was.
